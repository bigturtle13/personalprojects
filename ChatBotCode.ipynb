The attack was filmed by onlookers and the recording went\\nviral. The shark was later captured by fishermen and killed. This was the third fatal tiger shark attack\\nin the area since 2022.[65]\\nBetween 1959 and 1976, 4,668 tiger sharks were culled in the state of Hawaii in an effort to protect the\\ntourism industry.[66] Despite damaging the shark population, these efforts were shown to be\\nineffective in decreasing the number of interactions between humans and tiger sharks.
